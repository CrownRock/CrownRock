- 👋 Hi, I’m @CrownRock
- 👀 I’m interested in web development, preferably focused on CSS, Bootstrap, JS, React, Mongo, Express and Node. I am willing and able to learn new languages and skills. I have basic skills in SQL and WordPress. I am also proficient in Adobe Creative Cloud => Photoshop, Illustrator, Acrobat and Dreamweaver. Currently I am using VS Code 99% of the time. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... all the time. Depends on what I need to know. I love working in CSS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web development. I prefer Bootstrap and other Grid frameworks over WordPress.
- 📫 How to reach me - sstout7576@gmail.com
- 2020 was very challenging for all of us, and now I'm glad to be on track once again working on various projects. I update my portfolio at least once a week.
