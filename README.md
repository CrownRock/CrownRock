- 👋 Hi, I’m @CrownRock
- 👀 I love web design and development. My favorite aspect of coding is CSS and lately SCSS. I have experience in JS, React, Mongo, Express and Node. I enjoy learning new languages and skills. I learned my first basic skills, SQL and WordPress, circa 2008. I am also proficient in Adobe Creative Cloud => Photoshop, Illustrator, Acrobat and Dreamweaver though my preferred IDE is VS Code since 2020. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... all the time. Depends on what I need to know.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web development. I used Bootstrap for about 5 years and now I'm switching to media queiries to make my projects responsive.

- 2020 was very challenging for all of us, and now I'm glad to be on track once again working on various projects.
